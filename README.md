ontoProc -- an R package for working with multiple biomedical ontologies

In 2024, interfaces to owlready2 and bioregistry have been added to improve

Includes the ctmarks app for examining cell types through ontological characterization

We also consider how to produce OBO stanzas for expanding existing ontologies

With this we can formally describe novel cell types (CL:X01 is an 'extended CL tag')
