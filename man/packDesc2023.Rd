\note{
Brief survey of functions available to load serialized
ontology_index instances imported from OBO.  Focus is on versions added in 2023.
Several manual interventions were needed -- cellosaurus was too large to use the
script in inst/scripts/desc.R, and a number of ontologies do not have 2023 versions.
